# RNN Exploration

Welcome to **RNN Exploration** — a collection of hands-on projects showcasing various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including custom-built models and implementations using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

This repo is both a learning journal and a technical showcase — where understanding, experimentation, and creativity meet.

---

## Purpose

- Understand how RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs work under the hood.
- Build models from scratch to deepen intuition.
- Apply RNNs to real tasks such as sequence prediction, time series forecasting, and classification.
- Explore different frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and design styles.
